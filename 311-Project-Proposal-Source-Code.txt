    \large\textbf{Introduction:} \\[5pt]
    Bangladesh one of the most populated countries and till date there are over 40 lacs cases which are pending in the court of Bangladesh. This means there is a clear barrier to the access of justice. As it is the fundamental right of every citizen to have access to justice. The barrier is subjective barrier as the physical court exists, due to overwhelming of cases, it takes years to solve the case. In this regard to help the underprivileged people of the country and give them the medium of access to justice, the digitalization of certain portion of the legal system as well as giving them the scope of free legal consultation is very important. This is where our website “The Legal Nexus” would play a major role. \\[30pt]
